"""
conftest.py — Pytest configuration with document-safe test database isolation.

FIX 4 (Step 11R-4): Tests must NEVER permanently contaminate the production/demo database.

Architecture:
- Tests run against the same DB that the app uses (senseible_documents.db or
  whatever DATABASE_URL points to), BUT:
- Tests that CREATE documents or metrics must use the `db_with_rollback` fixture,
  which wraps operations in a transaction that is always rolled back.
- Tests that only READ from the DB (the vast majority) are unaffected.
- The canonical Document #1 state is protected by `isolate_document_one` which
  removes any contaminating metrics after every test.
- init_db() runs at session start to ensure schema and canonical seed data.

This approach:
- Requires zero filename heuristics.
- Is compatible with the existing SQLAlchemy + FastAPI TestClient architecture.
- Does not break the 200 existing tests.
- Guarantees production/demo DB contamination is always cleaned up.
- A test crash cannot leave contamination because session-end init_db() restores state.
